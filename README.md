docker-openldap
===============

A Docker image running OpenLDAP on Debian stable ("wheezy" at the moment). The
Dockerfile is inspired by
[cnry/openldap](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/cnry/openldap/), but as said
before, running a stable Debian and be a little less verbose, but more complete
in the configuration.

NOTE: On purpose, there is no secured channel (TLS/SSL), because I believe that
this service should never be exposed to the internet, but only be used directly
by other Docker containers using the `--link` option.

Usage
-----

The most simple form would be to start the application like so (however this is
not the recommended way - see below):

    docker run -d -p 389:389 -e SLAPD_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword -e SLAPD_DOMAIN=ldap.example.org dinkel/openldap

To get the full potential this image offers, one should first create a data-only
container (see "Data persistence" below), start the OpenLDAP daemon as follows:

    docker run -d -name openldap --volumes-from your-data-container dinkel/openldap

An application talking to OpenLDAP should then `--link` the container:

    docker run -d --link openldap:openldap image-using-openldap

The name after the colon in the `--link` section is the hostname where the
OpenLDAP daemon is listening to (the port is the default port `389`).

Configuration (environment variables)
-------------------------------------

For the first run, one has to set at least two environment variables. The first

    SLAPD_PASSWORD

sets the password for the `admin` user.

The second

    SLAPD_DOMAIN

sets the DC (Domain component) parts. E.g. if one sets it to `ldap.example.org`,
the generated base DC parts would be `...,dc=ldap,dc=example,dc=org`.

There is an optinal third variable

    SLAPD_ORGANIZATION (defaults to $SLAPD_DOMAIN)

that represents the human readable company name (e.g. `Example Inc.`).

The fourth (somewhat) optional variable

    SLAPD_CONFIG_PASSWORD

allows password protected access to the `dn=config` branch. This helps to
reconfigure the server without interruption (read the
[official documentation](http://www.openldap.org/doc/admin24/guide.html#Configuring%20slapd)).

One can load additional schemas provided in the `slapd` package that are not
installed using the

    SLAPD_ADDITIONAL_SCHEMAS

environment variable with comma-separated enties. As of writing these
instructions, there are the following additional schemas available:
`collective`, `corba`, `duaconf`, `dyngroup`, `java`, `misc`, `openldap`, `pmi`
and `ppolicy`.

At least one quite common module is neither loaded nor configured by default (I
am talking about the `memberof` overlay). In order to activate this (and
possibly other modules in the future), there is another environment variable
called

    SLAPD_ADDITIONAL_MODULES

which can hold comma-separated enties. It will try to run `.ldif` files with
a corresponsing name from th `module` directory. Currently only `memberof` is
avaliable.

The maximal number of open file can largely affect the RAM usage of the slapd
process. You can use the environment variable

    MAX_NOFILE

to change the maximal number of open files. The default number is 8192.

After the first start of the image (and the initial configuration), these
envirnonment variables are not evaluated anymore.

Data persistence
----------------

The image exposes two directories (`VOLUME ["/etc/ldap", "/var/lib/ldap"]`).
The first holds the "static" configurationm while the second holds the actual
database. Please make sure that these two directories are saved (in a data-only
container or alike) in order to make sure that everything is restored after a
restart of the container.
